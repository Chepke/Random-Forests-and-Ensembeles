>##Bagging
Bagging is used on prediction of non-numerical data only if the algorithms used for the base model supports non-numerical data. This is handled through one-hot encoding which converts variables into binary variables

**Decision trees
Decision trees are used to train standalone models since it's an imbalanced clasiffier which can overfit or underfit. Use it with cross validation score
